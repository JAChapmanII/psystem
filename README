Building:
	make

Running:
	./seuler

Controls:
	Space: switchs between:
		tracking the center of the system and
		tracking the first particle
	p: pauses or unpauses the simulation

	 Left mouse button: add a particle at mouse location
	Right mouse button: remove the particle under the mouse
	Note: in the default tracking mode (system center), these operations may
	make it appear as if the camera jumped, because it does.

	Mouse wheel: alter the size of the to be created particle
	Note: there is currently no indication of the size it will be, this will be
	changed to include feedback on this variable.
